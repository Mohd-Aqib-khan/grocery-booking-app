The database container is running.
The DATABASE_URL in the docker-compose.yml file matches the POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, and POSTGRES_DB.
Database Scripts Not Running
Ensure:

SQL files in the db-scripts folder have correct permissions (chmod -R 755 ./db-scripts).
The volume mapping for db-scripts is correct in docker-compose.yml.

Future Enhancements
Add authentication with role-based access control.
Implement a user-friendly front-end interface.
Add unit and integration tests.
